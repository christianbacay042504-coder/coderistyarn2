-- Database Import Instructions --

The tour guide user type has been added to your SJDM Tours database structure.

## To complete the setup, you need to:

1. **Import the updated database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p sjdm_tours < sjdm_tours.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the import was successful** by checking:
   - Users table has 'tour_guide' in user_type enum
   - Tour guide accounts exist (Juan Santos, Maria Reyes)
   - Tour guide profiles table exists

## Tour Guide Test Accounts:
- **Email**: juan.santos@tourguide.com
- **Password**: password123

- **Email**: maria.reyes@tourguide.com  
- **Password**: password123

## Fixed Issues:
✅ Added 'preferences_set' column to users table
✅ Fixed foreign key constraints (tables created in correct order)
✅ Added tour guide redirection logic in login system
✅ Updated JavaScript to handle tour guide user type

## After Import:
1. Try logging in with the tour guide accounts
2. You should be redirected to: tour-guide/dashboard.php
3. The "Invalid email or password" error should be resolved

If you're still getting login errors after importing the database, the issue might be:
- Database wasn't imported correctly
- MySQL connection issues
- File permissions

Run the import command first, then test the login.
